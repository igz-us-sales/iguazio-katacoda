## Running your code
* Click here <a href="https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-30040-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/lab/tree/mlrun/mlrun_course/01-the-basics.ipynb#sec2">Jupyter Notebooks</a>

## Lets review additional code
* new_function() In this case this sets an empty template to run th code defined in this Notebook
    - We will see later how we use the function definition for jobs running outside of the Notebook container
* We will save any artifacts generated by the execution in the directory defined as **artifact_path**
* Click On Run->Run All Cells
* Scroll down and wait until the execution is completed
* Below the cell running ***train_run = newfn.run*** you will see some results
    - Click on dataset.csv to visualize the results
    - This was generated by the code using the function log_artifact. You can see the code if you scroll up to the definition of the **my_job** function

## Review execution in the MLRun UI
Once complete, you can track the experiment in the 
<a href="https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-30068-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/">MLRun UI tab</a>
